# GameProject
GameProject from Scratch. C++ directX.

Welcome to this project. This will be a complete game in C++. I started this from scratch creating everything myself except for the deep functions for window creation, where I used some parts of the window.h and the render Functions from the directx libary.

The project concept is a space invader clone with a leauge of legends ability system. 
The character has 4 abilities on Q, W, E and R. Aswell as a normal attack which is a normal shot just like in any space invader clone. If you wish to see the specific ability designs then text me.

The goal of this project is to learn working with C++ and learning how an engine works. 
Many things like Scene Graph, Render Pipeline, Physics engine or timesteps are things which are given to you in an engine. Doing and understanding it yourself is another thing though. Which is why I am doing this project. 
Have fun looking into it!
